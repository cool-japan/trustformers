2. **Question 2**: [Your second question] 
3. **Question 3**: [Additional questions]

## Code Context (if applicable)
If your question relates to specific code, please share relevant snippets:

```rust
// Rust code example
use trustformers::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Your code here
}
```

or

```python
# Python code example
import trustformers

# Your code here
```

## Expected Behavior vs Actual
